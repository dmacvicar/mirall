# Mirall

## Introduction

Mirall synchronizes your folders with another computer.

The ultimate goals of Mirall are:

* Network location aware: should not try to sync against your NAS if you are
  not in the home network
* It is a zero-interaction tool. So forget about resolving conflicts.
* It should work silently and realiably.

Mirall is in early stages of development, and may still eat your
files or hang your computer.

* Network location awareness not implemented yet
* Current version supports local and remote (sftp and smb) folders.
* It is powered by csync (http://www.csync.org), however
  the user does not know and other tools will be incorporated to provide other
  functionality.

## Current issues

* No sane way to backup conflicting versions yet, this should be solved
  in a near csync release (--conflictcopy, available in Jann's branch).
  Right now the newest copy wins.
* You can't remove folder configurations
  Workaround: delete ~/.local/share/data/Mirall/folders/$alias and restart
* Some tasks block the GUI (initial setup of watchers)
* May be some concurrency issues

## Roadmap

* Improve robustness to minimize user interaction
* Improve feedback and sync results
* Add support for other folder types: tarsnap, duplicity, git (SparkleShare)

## Requirements

* Linux (currently it uses inotify to detect file changes)
* unison installed in the local and remote machine
  (you should not care if you got Mirall with your favorite
   distribution)
